# Supervised learning

## Description
Supervised classification using a synthetic dataset from Scikit and the following learning algorithms: <br>
Linear regression <br>
Logistic regression <br>
k nearest neighbours (kNN) <br>
Simple perceptron <br>
Multi-layer feed forward neural network <br>

## Dependencies
sys <br>
sklearn <br>
random <br>
matplotlib <br>
numpy

## Functionality
Reports the accuracy of different learning algorithms on both binary and multi-class classification problems to compare performance. Uses a syntehtic dataset generated using scikit learn. 
 
## Missing functionality
Logistic regression and linear regression reports same accuracy for all diffs after adding non-linear feature, and thus seems to indicate that the algorithm either doesn't train properly or that there is something wrong with the accuracy calculations for these cases. 

## Usage
Open terminal. Navigate to file directory. Run jupyter notebook.
